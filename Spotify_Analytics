#In this project I asked myself questions about the database I was given

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY 2 DESC

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
--Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH ninja AS (
SELECT i.artist_name, AVG(i.popularity) as popularity1
FROM Spotifydata i
GROUP BY i.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, popularity1, 'TOP STAR' as tag
FROM ninja
WHERE popularity1 >= 90
ORDER BY popularity1 DESC
